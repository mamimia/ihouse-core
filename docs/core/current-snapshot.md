## Current Phase
Phase 1040 — P0: System Closure, Regression, Docs Alignment

## Last Closed Phase
Phase 1039 — OM Role & Assignment Inline Help

## System Status

**[...System status through Phase 958 unchanged...] Phase 979 Guest Dossier & Worker Check-in Hardening: Full Guest Dossier system — `/guests/{guest_id}` backend endpoint with denormalized response (stays, check-in records, portal data), tabbed frontend dossier page (Current Stay, Activity, Contact), timeline-aware status badges (In Stay / Past Stay / Upcoming), compact metadata layout, Guest Portal QR/Send Link actions, full-row clickability on Guest Directory. Worker check-in lifecycle: self-healing mechanism auto-completes orphaned ACKNOWLEDGED tasks via `forceCompleteTask()` state-machine walk when booking is already `checked_in`. Breadcrumb navigation leak suppressed on all mobile staff routes. MobileStaffShell horizontal gutter (`paddingInline: var(--space-4)`). LiveCountdown human-readable tiered format: `>48h→13d`, `24-48h→1d 6h`, `<24h→18h 20m`, `<1h→42m 08s`; adaptive tick rate. Worker Home broken modal removed (source of `worker.btn_complete` i18n token leak) — Next Up cards now navigate to role-specific task flows. Deployed to Railway + Vercel.**

**Phase 1003 Canonical Block Classification & Bookings UX:** Established functional dual-surface Bookings page separating true operating stays from Calendar Blocks. Viewport-safe Status Modal completely replaces fragile popover logic. All sync-based availability rows labeled explicitly with `is_calendar_block = true`.

**Phase 1021 Owner Bridge Flow:** Replaced the misleading "Go to Owners" CTA for role=Owner staff users with a real `LinkOwnerModal`. Modal carries over personal details and all property assignments from the staff record into the owner create/link flow.

**Phase 1022 Operational Manager Takeover Gate:** Full end-to-end task takeover model. `MANAGER_EXECUTING` status in task state machine. Audit chain: `original_worker_id`, `taken_over_by`, `taken_over_reason`, `taken_over_at`. Permission guards: Operational Manager scoped to assigned properties; Admin global fallback. Responsive execution drawer keeps manager on their board surface. All four worker wizards (`CheckinWizard`, `CheckoutWizard`, `CleanerWizard`, `MaintenanceWizard`) extracted and embedded in manager drawer via `TaskWizardRouter`. Build clean. Deployed commit `91f7114`. Staging visual verification pending for next session.

**Phase 1023 Staff Onboarding Error Clarity & Role Integrity:** UNKNOWN_ERROR masking removed — frontend now surfaces real backend error codes. Combined (checkin+checkout) role normalized to `[checkin, checkout]` array. Operational Manager invite route separated from worker sub-role logic.

**Phase 1024 Identity Mismatch & Auth-Email Repair Path:** Hardened auth-email repair flow for cases where staff card email is corrected but auth identity remains on old email. Admin surface surfaces identity mismatch state.

**Phase 1025 Public Property Submission Flow Hardening:** Stale-state blocking in public submission flow fixed. My Properties delete affordance added with confirmation dialog. Intake queue now shows submitter phone.

**Phase 1026 Operational Truth Semantics Lock:** Canonical semantics locked: PENDING includes ACKNOWLEDGED and IN_PROGRESS. COMPLETED and CANCELED excluded from default Pending view at backend level. Applies to all surfaces.

**Phase 1027 Stale Task & Past-Task Hygiene:** Historical task bleed-through fixed. ZTEST- hygiene rule established. `scripts/cleanup_probe_tasks.sql` created.

**Phase 1028 Primary/Backup Model Decision & Baton-Transfer Architecture:** `priority` INTEGER column added to `staff_property_assignments`. Primary/Backup model locked per property + lane. Baton-transfer designed: PENDING tasks may move, ACKNOWLEDGED/IN_PROGRESS tasks must not. INV-1010, INV-1011, INV-1012 locked.

**Phase 1029 Default Worker Task Filter COMPLETED Exclusion Hardened:** `GET /worker/tasks` default now excludes both COMPLETED and CANCELED at backend-canonical level. Regression test A8 added.

**Phase 1030 Task Lifecycle & Assignment Hardening:** All task creation, rescheduling, and baton-transfer paths enforce Primary/Backup model. Amendment reschedule healing, ad-hoc cleaning Primary selection, early-checkout healing, lane-aware baton-transfer, and promotion notice JSONB write all implemented. Commit `7732ab4`. Admin Pending exclusion of COMPLETED tasks staging-proven. INV-1010/1011/1012 extended.

**Phase 1031 Assignment Priority Normalization & Canonical Lane Protection (3 sub-commits):**
- `b5f5e8f` — Code-level gaps closed: early-checkout healing walks priority-ordered candidates (Primary first); backfill Primary-existence guard (Backup cannot steal NULL tasks when Primary exists in lane); ownerless-task guard emits `ERROR OWNERLESS_TASK_CREATED` on all failure paths. 161 tests pass.
- `7dcb4da` — DB + API normalization: `chk_priority_positive` constraint; trigger `fn_guard_assignment_priority_uniqueness` (blocks (property, lane, priority) collision); DB function `get_next_lane_priority()`. API write path now lane-aware: resolves worker lane from `worker_roles`, computes MAX(priority)+1, sets correct priority at insert. UNKNOWN-lane hard block replaces silent priority>=100 path.
- `89d3f45` — Canonical no-lane enforcement: trigger `fn_guard_assignment_requires_operational_lane` blocks INSERT for any worker without cleaner/maintenance/checkin/checkout. Removed 11 invalid rows (manager_not_worker ×8, ghost_no_permission_record ×2, owner_not_worker ×1). Audit table `phase_1031c_removed_assignments` created. DB proofs: invalid_rows=0, all 14 assignment rows in real operational lanes, zero priority collisions.
- Lane model locked: CLEANING / MAINTENANCE / CHECKIN_CHECKOUT only. UNKNOWN is not a valid product concept. No operational assignment without a valid lane.
- INV-1031-A/B/C/D added.

**Phase 1032 — Live Staging Proof + Baton-Transfer Closure (3 sub-commits):**
- `fb5b3ea` — Trigger race fix: `fn_guard_assignment_priority_uniqueness` was blocking baton-transfer promotions. Exempted UPDATE operations from the collision guard — atomic Backup→Primary promotion (priority=1) now succeeds.
- `6eedbda` — `POST /staff/assignments` 500 fix: PostgREST upsert was sending absent `priority` as NULL, violating `chk_priority_positive`. Fixed: `permissions_router.py` always includes `priority` in upsert payload (idempotent for existing rows, lane-aware for new rows).
- `a414a8c` — `GET /permissions/me` added to `permissions_router.py`: returns the caller's own `tenant_permissions` row including `comm_preference._promotion_notice`. Registered before `GET /permissions/{user_id}` to avoid path shadowing. Root cause of silent banner failure — endpoint was 404.
- **Live staging proofs (all confirmed):** baton-transfer E2E (KPG-500: Joey→Backup, แพรวา→Primary), promotion notice JSONB write in DB, `GET /permissions/me` HTTP 200, worker promotion banner visible in `/worker` UI (screenshot), `POST /staff/assignments` existing-row returns 201.
- **Final staging state:** KPG-500 CLEANING lane — แพรวา=Primary (priority=1), Joey=Backup (priority=2). This is a real live state change from the proof pass.
- **Open (not blocking):** promotion notice acknowledgement PATCH not built; legacy KPG-500 task distribution is pre-guard artifact, not a current write-path failure.

**Phase 1033 — Canonical Task Timing Hardening (+ OM Surface, Act As, Staff Onboarding):**
Implementation landed across multiple workstreams. Documentation closure was incomplete — now completed.
- **Worker Timing Gate Model (BUILT + STAGING-PROVEN):** `src/tasks/timing.py` — `compute_task_timing()`: `effective_due_at`, `ack_allowed_at` = due−24h, `start_allowed_at` = due−2h. CRITICAL priority bypasses all gates unconditionally. MAINTENANCE/GENERAL: no start gate. `due_time` kind-defaults written at task creation (`_KIND_DUE_TIME` map) and preserved on amendment reschedule. Worker router enriches every task response with 4 timing fields; `/acknowledge` and `/start` enforce hour-level UTC gates; structured errors `ACKNOWLEDGE_TOO_EARLY` / `START_TOO_EARLY` with `opens_in`.
- **Server-Driven Frontend Gates (BUILT + STAGING-PROVEN for checkin/checkout):** `WorkerTaskCard.tsx` — `AckButton` + `StartButton` components read server-provided fields. "Opens in Xh Ym" flash on early press (3s then revert). `computeOpensIn()` replaces local date math. All 3 worker op pages (`cleaner`, `checkout`, `checkin`) extended with 4 timing props threaded to `WorkerTaskCard`. Maintenance timing gate: BUILT but staging proof 🔲 (no live task available during session).
- **Operational Manager Surface (BUILT, SURFACED — not screenshot-proven):** OM shell + 6-page navigation (Hub, Alerts, Stream, Team, Bookings, Calendar). Hub is cockpit-first: Alert rail → Metrics → Task Board → Stream. `task_takeover_router.py` expanded: `/manager/alerts`, `/manager/team-overview`, `/tasks/{id}/notes` endpoints. `DraftGuard` on all OM draft pages (admin-only access while surface matures). Team page: real data — property names, lane coverage matrix, worker roster.
- **Person-Specific Act As / Preview As (BUILT, SURFACED — not screenshot-proven):** Both surfaces carry `name` + `user_id` query params. Banners display "Role · [Person Name]". `checkin_checkout` dual-role validation fixed (requires BOTH checkin AND checkout). Auth fixes: `/act-as` + `/preview` added to `PUBLIC_PREFIXES`; `apiFetch` logout on 401 only (never 403).
- **Staff Onboarding Hardening (BUILT, SURFACED — not screenshot-proven):** Manager role validation, canonical role lock enforced, approval history always visible, Work Permit rule, combined checkin+checkout tile.
- **Product Decision Locked:** OM task model. Worker layer = Acknowledge/Start/Complete. Manager layer = Monitor/Takeover/Reassign/Note. `ManagerTaskCard` as drill-down intervention layer only. Phase 1034 (OM-1) spec approved — not yet built.
- **INV-1033-TIMING:** `ack_allowed_at` = `effective_due_at` − 24h; `start_allowed_at` = `effective_due_at` − 2h. CRITICAL bypasses all gates. Frontend timing state is derived exclusively from server-provided fields — no local computation.
- Commits: `305a083` → `e79adb2` (OM surface + Act As + staff onboarding), `cd8a04a`, `1480f03` (timing model). Branch: `checkpoint/supabase-single-write-20260305-1747`.

## Request Flow (POST /webhooks/{provider})

```
HTTP  →  Logging middleware (X-Request-ID)
      →  verify_webhook_signature        (403)
      →  JWT auth / verify_jwt           (403)
      →  Rate limit / InMemoryRateLimiter (429 + Retry-After)
      →  validate_ota_payload            (400)
      →  ingest_provider_event           (200 + idempotency_key)
      →  500 on unexpected error
```

## Health Check Response

```json
{
  "status": "ok | degraded | unhealthy",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "env": "production",
  "checks": {

## Escalation Channel Architecture (Phase 196 — Per-Worker)

```
Tier 1 — in-app (always first, iHouse task acknowledgement)
Tier 2 — preferred external channel (per worker, one of:)
            LINE       → channel_type="line"      (Thailand/JP dominant)
            WhatsApp   → channel_type="whatsapp"  (SEA/EU/Global)
            Telegram   → channel_type="telegram"  (live — Phase 203)
Tier 3 — External (one of:)
            SMS        → channel_type="sms"       (Phase 212)
            Email      → channel_type="email"     (Phase 213)
```

**No global fallback chain.** Each worker has their own `channel_type` in `notification_channels`. The dispatcher reads it and routes there only.

## Key Files — Channel Layer (Phases 124 + 168 + 177 + 196)

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/channels/line_escalation.py` | LINE pure module — should_escalate, build_line_message, HMAC-SHA256 verify |
| `src/api/line_webhook_router.py` | GET+POST /line/webhook |
| `src/channels/whatsapp_escalation.py` | WhatsApp pure module — same pattern as LINE |
| `src/api/whatsapp_router.py` | GET+POST /whatsapp/webhook |
| `src/channels/telegram_escalation.py` | Telegram pure module — should_escalate, build_telegram_message, format_telegram_text (Markdown), is_priority_eligible (Phase 203) |
| `src/channels/notification_dispatcher.py` | Core dispatcher — routes by worker's channel_type. CHANNEL_LINE/WHATSAPP/TELEGRAM/SMS constants. No global chain. |
| `src/channels/sla_dispatch_bridge.py` | Connects sla_engine.evaluate() → dispatch_notification(). Per-worker routing. |
| `src/channels/notification_delivery_writer.py` | Best-effort delivery log writer (notification_delivery_log table) |

## Key Files — API Layer

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/api/webhooks.py` | POST /webhooks/{provider} — OTA ingestion |
| `src/api/financial_router.py` | GET /financial/{booking_id} |
| `src/api/auth.py` | JWT verification |
| `src/api/rate_limiter.py` | Per-tenant rate limiting |
| `src/api/health.py` | Dependency health checks |
| `src/schemas/responses.py` | OpenAPI Pydantic response models |
| `src/main.py` | FastAPI app entrypoint (all routers registered) |

## Key Files — Task Layer (Phases 111–117)

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/tasks/task_model.py` | TaskKind (6 kinds incl GUEST_WELCOME), TaskStatus, TaskPriority, WorkerRole, Task dataclass |
| `src/tasks/task_automator.py` | Pure tasks_for_booking_created / canceled / amended |
| `src/tasks/pre_arrival_tasks.py` | Pure tasks_for_pre_arrival — GUEST_WELCOME + enriched CHECKIN_PREP (Phase 206) |
| `src/tasks/task_writer.py` | Supabase upsert/cancel/reschedule |
| `src/tasks/task_router.py` | GET /tasks, GET /tasks/{id}, PATCH /tasks/{id}/status, POST /tasks/pre-arrival/{booking_id} |
| `src/tasks/sla_engine.py` | evaluate() — ACK_SLA_BREACH + COMPLETION_SLA_BREACH. CRITICAL_ACK_SLA_MINUTES=5. |
| `src/services/conflict_auto_resolver.py` | Phase 207 — run_auto_check() — auto-conflict on BOOKING_CREATED/AMENDED |

## Key Invariants (Locked — Do Not Change)

- `apply_envelope` is the single write authority — no adapter reads/writes booking_state directly
- `event_log` is append-only — no updates, no deletes ever
- `booking_id = "{source}_{reservation_ref}"` — deterministic, canonical (Phase 36)
- `reservation_ref` normalized by `normalize_reservation_ref()` before use (Phase 68)
- HTTP endpoint routes through `ingest_provider_event` → pipeline → `apply_envelope`
- `tenant_id` from verified JWT `sub` claim only — NEVER from payload body (Phase 61+)
- `booking_state` is a read model ONLY — must NEVER contain financial calculations
- All financial read endpoints query `booking_financial_facts` ONLY — never `booking_state`
- Deduplication: most-recent `recorded_at` per `booking_id`
- Epistemic tier: FULL→A, ESTIMATED→B, PARTIAL→C. Worst tier wins in aggregated endpoints.
- OTA_COLLECTING net is NEVER included in owner_net_total — honesty invariant
- External channels (LINE, WhatsApp, Telegram) are escalation fallbacks ONLY — never source of truth
- `notification_channels` is the per-worker channel preference store — no global fallback chain

Phase 345 — see `docs/core/planning/` for next cycle.

**Phase 1034 — OM-1 Manager Task Intervention Model (CLOSED):** `POST /tasks/{id}/takeover-start` (timing-gate bypass, atomic walk, audit), `POST /tasks/{id}/reassign` (property-scoped workers, handoff note), `POST /tasks/{id}/notes` (source-typed), `ManagerTaskCard.tsx` + `ManagerTaskDrawer` (read-only timing strip, Takeover/Reassign/Note), `ReassignPanel` (named workers, kind-filtered). `jwt_auth` vs `jwt_identity` bug fixed. `task_id`/`id` field normalized. Backend-proven in DB. End-to-end UI proof pending.

**Phase 1035 — OM-1 Stream Redesign (CLOSED — Backend Proven):** Data source migrated from `audit_events` to live `tasks` + `bookings` tables. Tasks tab: `GET /manager/tasks` (live operational queue, urgency sort). Bookings tab: `GET /manager/stream/bookings` (yesterday → +7d, confirmed only). Sessions tab: removed. Human-first property naming enforced everywhere. Property name resolution bug fixed: backend was joining `properties.id` (bigint) instead of `properties.property_id` (text). `ReassignPanel` empty state fixed. DB SQL proofs pass. UI visual proof pending.

**Phase 1036 — OM-1: Stream Hardening (CLOSED):** `POST /tasks/adhoc` — generic ad-hoc task creation (CLEANING/MAINTENANCE/GENERAL), CHECKIN_PREP/CHECKOUT_VERIFY blocked, duplicate guardrail (409 + `?force=true` override), lane-aware auto-assign, audit log. Stream: canonical ordering (CHECKOUT→CLEAN→CHECKIN within same property+day), `KindSequenceBadge`, Add Task button in header wired to `/tasks/adhoc`, conflict guardrail UI, scope-aware booking empty state. Build clean. Deployed `054c83a`.

**Phase 1037 — Staff Onboarding Access Hardening (CLOSED):** Resolves the staff onboarding 500 error and email deliverability chain. Four sub-commits on branch `checkpoint/supabase-single-write-20260305-1747`:
- **1037a** `POST /admin/staff`: New manual create endpoint provisions a real Supabase Auth UUID via `generate_link(type=invite)` before writing `tenant_permissions`. Identity invariant: `comm_preference.email == auth_email` always maintained.
- **1037b** SMTP bypass: switched from `invite_user_by_email` (sends spam-prone Supabase email) to `generate_link` (returns raw URL, no email sent). Admin sees copyable link + ✉ Email button in success overlay.
- **1037c** True hard delete: `DELETE /admin/staff/{user_id}` atomically removes from `tenant_permissions`, `staff_assignments`, AND `auth.users` (via `admin.delete_user()`). Previously only `tenant_permissions` was removed, leaving orphaned auth records that blocked re-invite.
- **1037d** Bulletproof two-pass auth: Pass A = `generate_link(type=invite)` for new users; Pass B = `generate_link(type=magiclink)` for any existing-user signal (7 error variants including 422, 'in use', 'duplicate'). Last resort: `422 USER_ALREADY_EXISTS` with clear human message — never a raw 500. Orphaned `esweb3@gmail.com` auth record cleaned from `auth.users` directly.

**Phase 1038 — Supervisory Role Assignment Hardening (CLOSED):** Fixes root cause of OM assignment failure. `POST /staff/assignments` was applying worker-lane validation to supervisory roles — now bypasses for manager/admin/owner with `priority=100`. `GET /staff/property-lane/{id}` returns `supervisors[]` alongside worker lanes. Frontend property rows branch on role: supervisory → supervisor name chips (👤 Name); workers → Primary/Backup badges unchanged. Real backend errors surfaced in UI (`apiFetch` reads body before throw; `handleSave` catch uses `e.message`). Orphaned `0330` rows cleaned. Commit `b4150cf`.

**Phase 1038b — Mobile Stream Responsive Hardening + Multi-Supervisor Chips (CLOSED):** (1) `activeTab` persisted to `sessionStorage` — survives orientation change/resize, no more Bookings→Tasks reset. (2) `BookingRow` isMobile prop: mobile portrait renders vertical card layout (3 rows); desktop unchanged. (3) Supervisor chip strip shows ALL supervisors for property — first 2 as chips, `+N` overflow, current user highlighted purple. `No supervisor yet` only when truly empty. Commit `eae8705`.

**Phase 1039 — OM Role & Assignment Inline Help (CLOSED):** Two UI additions to `[userId]/page.tsx`: (1) OM info block — renders when `role === 'manager'`, explains supervisory scope model in 5 bullets (what OM is, multi-villa, multi-OM, no Primary/Backup, what chips mean). (2) Supervisory context note — renders for manager/admin, placed above Assigned Properties list. UI-only change. TypeScript 0 errors. Staging proof captured on Nana G (Operational Manager) — desktop + mobile. Commits `cb51bf8` (code) + `22c8815` (spec closed).

## Operational Troubleshooting Note

> **Anti-Gravity workspace freeze root cause (2026-04-02):** `.git/config` contained `extensions.worktreeconfig=true` which caused Anti-Gravity to become silent/unresponsive inside this repo. Fixed by: `git config --local --unset extensions.worktreeconfig`. **Do not reintroduce this setting.** If Anti-Gravity becomes silent again inside this repo, check `.git/config` first.

## Tests

**8,144 passed, 18 failed (pre-existing mock stubs — wave7 takeover + guest_owner_auth), 22 skipped. TypeScript 0 errors. 294 test files. 126 API router files. 63 frontend pages. 48 RLS-protected tables. 6 storage buckets. Phases 981–1039 closed. Active: Phase 1040.**

> ⚠️ The 18 failures are pre-existing test mock mismatches in `test_wave7_manual_booking_takeover.py` (8), `test_guest_owner_auth.py` (1), `test_task_system_e2e.py` (1), `test_task_writer_contract.py` (1) — none introduced by Phase 1038/1038b. Tracked for repair in next test hardening pass.
