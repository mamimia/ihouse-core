## Canonical policies

### 1. Least-privilege invalid-role fallback

If a role value in `tenant_permissions` is not a member of `CANONICAL_ROLES`, the system defaults to `worker`.

Enforced in:
- `POST /invite/accept/{token}` — `invite_router.py`
- `POST /auth/login` — `auth_login_router.py`
- `POST /auth/google-callback` — `auth_login_router.py`

### 2. Admin cannot be provisioned via invite

The invite accept endpoint validates role against `INVITABLE_ROLES` (`CANONICAL_ROLES` minus `admin`).

### 3. Canonical role registry

All valid roles are defined in `services/canonical_roles.py`:

| Set | Contents |
|---|---|
| `CANONICAL_ROLES` | admin, manager, ops, owner, worker, cleaner, checkin, checkout, maintenance |
| `INVITABLE_ROLES` | CANONICAL_ROLES − {admin} |
| `FULL_ACCESS_ROLES` | admin, manager |
| `STAFF_ROLES` | worker, cleaner, checkin, checkout, maintenance, ops |
| `IDENTITY_ONLY` | identity_only (not a tenant role — identity-level access class) |

### 4. Identity continuity

A single Supabase Auth UUID anchors all identity providers (email, Google, future).
`lookup_user_tenant(db, uuid)` returns the same tenant/role regardless of auth method.
`provision_user_tenant` uses upsert on `(tenant_id, user_id)` — no duplicates.

### 5. Password policy (Phase 873)

Canonical rules defined in `hooks/usePasswordRules.ts`:
- 8+ characters, 1 uppercase, 1 number, 1 special character

Enforced on all surfaces: `/register`, `/login/reset`, `/update-password`, `/invite/[token]`, `/profile`.

- Guest-origin auth context preservation — structurally ready, functionally unbuilt (deferred)
