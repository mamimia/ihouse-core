# Ops Manager Stream — Locked Product Definition
**Phase 1035 — locked before implementation**  
**Date:** 2026-04-01

---

## What Stream IS

The Manager Stream is a **real-time operational command surface**, not an audit log.

Its purpose: give the Ops Manager a single view that answers  
**"What needs my attention right now, and what is coming up that I need to be ready for?"**

History of what happened belongs in `/admin/audit`, not here.

---

## Data Source Model

| Tab | Old (wrong) source | New (correct) source |
|---|---|---|
| Tasks | `audit_events` — past events | `tasks` table — live status |
| Bookings | `audit_events` — history | `bookings` table — operational window |
| Sessions | `audit_events` — admin noise | **Removed from OM Stream entirely** |

---

## Tab 1: Tasks

### Visibility rules
Status drives visibility. **Date does not.**

| Include | Exclude |
|---|---|
| PENDING | COMPLETED — always hidden |
| ACKNOWLEDGED | CANCELED — always hidden |
| IN_PROGRESS | |
| MANAGER_EXECUTING | |

**Old open tasks are overdue, not historical.**  
A PENDING task from 3 days ago belongs at the top of the list as OVERDUE, not hidden.  
A COMPLETED task from yesterday is gone. Forever.

### Sort order (urgency-first)
1. **OVERDUE** — due_date < today, any open status → red badge, top of list
2. **TODAY** — due_date = today → amber badge
3. **UPCOMING** — due in next 7 days → sorted by due_date asc
4. **No due date / far future** → sorted by created_at asc, shown last

### Row display
- Property **human name first** ("Emuna Villa"), code secondary in small text ("KPG-500")
- Task kind label (Cleaning / Check-in / Check-out / Maintenance)
- Status chip
- Assigned worker **display name** (not UUID)
- Due date and urgency indicator
- Click → `ManagerTaskDrawer`

---

## Tab 2: Bookings

**Operational booking runway. Not booking event history.**

### Data source
`bookings` table (via `GET /manager/stream/bookings`).

### What "operationally alive" means
A booking must be visible until the guest has checked out. **The window is not the only filter — status is.**

| Booking state | Include? | Label |
|---|---|---|
| Guest departing today (`end_date = today`) | ✓ | "Departing Today" |
| Guest arriving today (`start_date = today`) | ✓ | "Arriving Today" |
| **Guest currently in property** (`start_date < today AND end_date > today`) | ✓ | "Active Stay — Out [date]" |
| Departing tomorrow | ✓ | "Departing Tomorrow" |
| Arriving tomorrow | ✓ | "Arriving Tomorrow" |
| Upcoming in next 7 days | ✓ | "Arriving in Xd" |
| Status: cancelled / rejected | ✗ | Hidden |
| Status: checked_out / completed | ✗ | Hidden |

**Active in-stay bookings are the highest operational priority.**
A booking that started 3 days ago is still alive — the guest is in the property right now.
Hiding it because `start_date` is older than `window_start` is a bug, not correct behavior.

### Backend query — three-part merge (Phase 1037 fix)
1. `start_date BETWEEN window_start AND window_end` — captures upcoming arrivals
2. `end_date BETWEEN window_start AND window_end` — captures near-future departures
3. `start_date < today AND end_date >= today` — **captures active in-stay bookings** (was missing)

Results deduplicated by `booking_id`.

### Sort order
1. Departing today (checkout urgency — highest priority)
2. Arriving today
3. Active in-stay (sorted by end_date asc — soonest departure first)
4. Departing tomorrow
5. Arriving tomorrow
6. Further upcoming (ascending by start_date)

### Row display
- Property human name first
- Guest name
- Arrival / Departure dates
- Status label: "Arriving Today" / "Active Stay — Out Apr 5" / "Departing Today" / "Arriving in Xd"
- Early Check-out indicator if `early_checkout_status = approved`

### Booking click-through action (Phase 1037 addition)
Clicking a booking row for an `active` or `checked_in` booking opens a booking action panel:
- **Early Check-out** action → opens `EarlyCheckoutPanel` (existing component, `embedded={true}`)
- This reuses the existing `POST /admin/bookings/{id}/early-checkout/request` + `/approve` endpoints
- Do NOT build a new early checkout flow. Reuse what exists.

---

## Tab 3: Sessions — REMOVED

`ACT_AS_STARTED` and `PREVIEW_OPENED` are developer/admin testing artifacts.  
No operational value to an Ops Manager.  
Sessions audit belongs in `/admin/audit` only.

**After Phase 1035: tabs are Tasks | Bookings only. Default tab: Tasks.**

---

## Property Naming Rule — All OM Surfaces

**Human name is the primary label everywhere.**

```
✓  Emuna Villa
   KPG-500          ← smaller, dimmer text

✗  CLEANING · KPG-500
```

Applies to: Stream rows, ManagerTaskCard header, TakeoverPanel, ReassignPanel context.

---

## Reassign Worker Selector — Proof Requirements

Not provable until:
1. A real worker with a display name appears in the selector (not just "open pool")
2. List filtered by task kind (cleaner for cleaning, checkin staff for checkin, etc.)
3. Empty state reads clearly ("No [Cleaning staff] found for [Emuna Villa]") — no raw `property_id` interpolation
4. Manual UUID entry is a collapsed hidden fallback, not the default visible path

Root cause of current broken state:  
When `GET /tasks/detail/{id}` fails → fallback shell has `property_id = ''`  
→ `/manager/team?task_kind=...` returns nothing → broken empty string displayed.  
Fix: do not show the Reassign panel until task is fully loaded from the detail endpoint.

---

## Note / Handoff / Reason — Locked Semantics

| Concept | Stored | Visible to |
|---|---|---|
| **Internal Manager Note** | `tasks.notes[]` `source="manager_note"` | Manager + Admin only |
| **Reassignment Reason** | `task_actions.details.reason` | Manager + Admin audit only |
| **Worker Handoff Message** | `tasks.notes[]` `source="handoff"` | Worker sees on their task surface |

These are three separate things. Never collapsed into one.

---

## Phase 1035 — Closure Conditions

This phase is NOT closed until all nine are proven:

1. Stream Tasks tab queries `tasks` table (not `audit_events`)
2. Stream Bookings tab queries `bookings` table (not `audit_events`)
3. Sessions tab is absent from the OM Stream
4. At least one task row on Stream is clickable and opens `ManagerTaskDrawer` with real task data
5. `ReassignPanel` shows a real named worker, or a correct "no compatible workers" message (not broken empty string)
6. Reassign execution → `assigned_to` changes in DB → verified by SQL query
7. Handoff message → written to `tasks.notes[]` with `source="handoff"` → verified DB or curl
8. Property human name is primary label in all OM surfaces
9. Broken empty state `"No workers found for ."` is fixed

**Status (2026-04-01):** Items 1, 2, 3, 5 (empty state fix), 7, 8 — backed proven via DB SQL. Items 4, 6 — pending UI proof. Phase 1035 closed pending final UI visual proof.

---

## Phase 1036 Additions (Active)

### Canonical Task Ordering — Locked Product Rule

Within the same property + same operational day (due_date), tasks MUST appear in canonical workflow order:

```
CHECKOUT_VERIFY  (1) ← guest departs, property turns over
CLEANING         (2) ← property cleaned between stays
CHECKIN_PREP     (3) ← new guest arrives
```

This is the real operational sequence. The manager must be able to read a turnover chain at a glance.

**Implementation:** Sort key within same urgency band and due_date:  
`property_id` (group) → `CANONICAL_KIND_ORDER` (workflow order within property+date group).

MAINTENANCE and GENERAL are appended after the canonical chain (order 4, 7).

`KindSequenceBadge` component renders a tiny color-coded label per row:  
`CHECKOUT` (red) / `CLEAN` (amber) / `CHECK-IN` (green).

---

### Add Task — Quick Action

Stream is a command surface, not a passive view. Managers must be able to create operational tasks from Stream directly.

**Entry point:** "Add Task" button in Stream header.

**Backend:** `POST /tasks/adhoc` — the **only** ad-hoc task creation endpoint for managers.
- This is NOT a second task creation system.
- It is a generalization of the existing `POST /tasks/cleaning/adhoc` pattern.

**Allowed kinds (ad-hoc creatable):**
| Kind | Allowed | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| CLEANING | ✓ | Extra cleaning, inter-stay refresh |
| MAINTENANCE | ✓ | Repair, inspection |
| GENERAL | ✓ | Any operational intervention |
| CHECKIN_PREP | ✗ | Booking-generated. Not ad-hoc. |
| CHECKOUT_VERIFY | ✗ | Booking-generated. Not ad-hoc. |

**Duplicate guardrail:**  
For CLEANING tasks: returns `409 DUPLICATE_TASK_CONFLICT` with `conflict_tasks[]` if an open CLEANING task already exists on the same property within ±1 day.  
Manager may override with `?force=true` — valid case: extra cleaning between stays, guest complaint mid-stay.

**Conflict UI:** Amber warning on 409. "Create Anyway (Extra Task)" override path. Manager sees conflict context before deciding.

---

### Booking Empty State — Scope-Aware Wording

The empty state for the Bookings tab must be scope-aware and explicit.

**If manager-scoped (assigned properties only):**  
`"No confirmed arrivals or departures in your scoped property (KPG-500) in the next 7 days."`

**If multi-property scope:**  
`"No confirmed arrivals or departures in your N scoped properties in the next 7 days."`

**This is not an error.** Explicitly communicates that the scope is applied and the result is correct.

Footer footnote also shows: `N properties in scope`.

---

## Phase 1036 — Closure Conditions

1. Reassign execution: `assigned_to` field changes in DB after real UI flow (not just API proof).
2. Handoff note visibility: worker sees the note card on their task surface (not just DB proof).
3. Add Task: create a task from Stream, confirm it appears in Stream, confirm conflict guardrail fires for a duplicate CLEANING attempt.
4. Canonical ordering: screenshot confirms `CHECKOUT → CLEAN → CHECK-IN` sequence renders correctly in real stream rows.
