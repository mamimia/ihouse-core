# iHouse Core – Phase Timeline (Append-Only Chronicle)

## Constitutional Rule

This file is the authoritative chronological archive of iHouse Core evolution.

Rules:

1. This document is strictly append-only.
2. No historical section may ever be edited or deleted.
3. Corrections must be appended as new entries.
4. Every Phase closure MUST append a new section here.
5. Phase closure is not complete without updating this file.

Supabase public.event_log created.
Supabase public.booking_state created.
Cloud persistence validated.
Composition root unified.
Explicit ports introduced.
Canonical runner defined.

## Phase 14 – StateStore Canonicalization
Single deterministic commit path enforced.
Replay never commits.
Hidden state writes eliminated.
Agent sidecar disabled.

## Phase 15 – Execution Surface Elimination
FastAPI sole execution entrypoint.
Parallel execution removed.
CoreExecutor declared single authority.

## Phase 16 – Canonical Domain Migration
16A – Canonical Schema Lock
16B – Deterministic Core Alignment
16C – Hard Idempotency Gate
Financial-grade atomic idempotency enforced.

## Phase 17A – Operational Runner & Governance Hardening
Canonical run_api.sh
Dev smoke scripts
CI enforcement rules
English-only repo policy
Secret-based API key
CI HTTP smoke validation

## Phase 17B – Canonical Governance Completion 
Finalize documentation alignment.
Treat user self-booking as canonical external event source.
Tighten operational invariants.

## Phase 17B – Canonical Governance Completion (Closed)
apply_envelope validated as single atomic write authority.
ALREADY_APPLIED replay validated with zero duplicate state mutation.
STATE_UPSERT formalized as DB-generated internal event.
booking_state last_envelope_id invariant validated.
Unique constraints and foreign keys verified live.
End-to-end determinism revalidated.
User self-booking confirmed as canonical external event source.

## Phase 17C – Overlap Rules, Business Dedup, Read Model Inquiry (Open)
Introduce overlap invariants.
Introduce business dedup keys.
Introduce stable read model inquiry API.

## Phase 17C — Overlap Rules, Business Dedup, Read Model Inquiry (Closed)
Completed:
- booking_state.check_in and booking_state.check_out added (date).
- Overlap gate enforced on BOOKING_CREATED using half-open range [check_in, check_out).
- Business identity dedup enforced for BOOKING_CREATED on (tenant_id, source, reservation_ref, property_id).
- Read model inquiry functions added:
  - read_booking_by_id(booking_id)
  - read_booking_by_business_key(tenant_id, source, reservation_ref, property_id)

Outcome:
- Deterministic, forward-only booking creation gate with overlap prevention and stable identity dedup.
- Read model inquiry is DB-backed and consistent.

## Phase 18 – Cancellation-aware Overlap (Closed)
Introduce cancellation-aware availability semantics and status-based booking lifecycle.

Canonical availability predicate:
- A booking is considered active for overlap checks iff status IS DISTINCT FROM 'canceled'.
- This intentionally treats NULL as active for legacy rows (forward-only, no backfill).

Forward-only write rules:
- On BOOKING_CREATED: always write status = 'active' for new rows.
- On BOOKING_CANCELED: set status = 'canceled' and bump version under row lock; update last_event_id and last_envelope_id.

Completed:
- booking_state.status column introduced.
- BOOKING_CANCELED branch implemented inside apply_envelope.
- Cancellation updates booking_state under row lock.
- Overlap gate modified to ignore canceled bookings using the canonical predicate.
- Canceling a booking allows a new overlapping booking to be created afterward.

Outcome:
- Cancellation removes bookings from availability checks without deleting historical data.
- Legacy rows with NULL status remain valid and are treated as active.
- Availability remains deterministic using half-open ranges [check_in, check_out).
- Booking lifecycle transitions remain forward-only and replay safe.
