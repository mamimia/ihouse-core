# iHouse Core — Construction Log

This file records what was actually implemented, in order.
It is not a roadmap.
It must match the DB gate behavior and repo state.

## Phase 17C — Overlap Rules, Business Dedup, Read Model Inquiry (Closed)
- booking_state.check_in and booking_state.check_out added (date)
- Overlap gate enforced on BOOKING_CREATED using half open range [check_in, check_out)
- Business identity dedup enforced on (tenant_id, source, reservation_ref, property_id)
- Read model inquiry functions added:
  - read_booking_by_id(booking_id)
  - read_booking_by_business_key(tenant_id, source, reservation_ref, property_id)

## Phase 18 — Cancellation Aware Overlap (Closed)
- booking_state.status added (text)
- BOOKING_CREATED writes status='active'
- BOOKING_CANCELED sets status='canceled' under row lock and bumps version
- Overlap ignores canceled bookings via:
  status IS DISTINCT FROM 'canceled'
  NULL treated as active for legacy rows
- Cancel allows a new overlapping booking to be created after cancellation

## Phase 19 — Event Version Discipline + DB Gate Validation (Closed)
- Introduced validate_emitted_event as DB gate validation for emitted events
- Validation runs before enum cast, enabling deterministic UNKNOWN_EVENT_KIND
- Transitional policy locked:
  - Missing event_version defaults to 1 only for allowlisted external kinds
  - Missing event_version for non external kinds rejects with EVENT_VERSION_REQUIRED
- Deterministic rejection codes locked:
  - UNKNOWN_EVENT_KIND
  - UNSUPPORTED_EVENT_VERSION
  - INVALID_PAYLOAD
  - EVENT_VERSION_REQUIRED
  - ALREADY_APPLIED
- T3 tests locked:
  - T3.1 missing_version external allowlisted => APPLIED
  - T3.2 unsupported_version => UNSUPPORTED_EVENT_VERSION
  - T3.3 unknown_kind => UNKNOWN_EVENT_KIND
